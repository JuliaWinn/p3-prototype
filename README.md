Inspired by the [Kinvey App Cost Estimator](http://www.kinvey.com/app-cost-estimator).

The numbers in this tool are placeholders and should not be used for any actual project guidance.

The colorscheme was inspired by the Google Material Design [color palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). 

The questions and outputs of this tool can be easily customized depending on your project's scope and needs.
